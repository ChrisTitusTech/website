 **List Root partition on each drive til you find your Install**  
`ls (hd0,msdos2)/`  
 _Check for the directory listing, if nothing, move to next_  
  
 **Now that we have found the proper drive lets boot to it**  
`grub> set root=(hd0,msdos2)`  
`grub> linux /boot/vmlinu (tab complete) root=/dev/sda1 (or the root linux partition)`  
`grub> initrd /boot/initrd (tab complete)`

## Fix GRUB Permanently

Now that we are booted in from GRUB Rescue, we can begin work with repairing our grub permanently. First we rebuild the /boot/grub/grub.cfg file:

Debian-based Distributions use **update-grub**  
Other Distributions use **grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg**

With the Configuration rebuilt, we now simply need to reinstall grub

`grub-install /dev/sda`  
  
_Note: /dev/sda is the DEVICE&#8230;_**NOT THE PARTITION**. 

## Other Methods of Repairing GRUB

  * Use the [https://www.supergrubdisk.org/ image on a USB drive to repair][1]
  * Use a vanilla server distribution pen drive to boot to prompt, then chroot to your existing install and reinstall GRUB.
