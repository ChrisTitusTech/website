This is an SSH guide to help you set up, configure, connect, and transfer files using SSH. <!--more-->

# Setup SSH

## Install SSH on your system

### Debian-Based

`sudo apt install openssh-server -y`

### CentOS/Fedora

`sudo yum -y install openssh-server`

### Arch

`sudo pacman -S openssh`

## Run SSH server on startup

```
sudo systemctl start ssh
sudo systemctl enable ssh
```
**Note: sshd instead of ssh for arch

## Configure SSH

**Make sure ufw isn&#8217;t blocking ssh and enable it for passthrough.** 

```
sudo ufw allow ssh
sudo ufw limit ssh
sudo ufw enable  
sudo ufw status
```

### Options for /etc/ssh/sshd_config

`PasswordAuthentication yes/no`   
_* No should be used when facing the internet and key authentication must be used for security_

`AllowTcpForwarding yes`  
`X11Forwarding yes`  
_* This is used to forward GUI programs (Xming required for Windows)_

`AllowUsers Fred Wilma`  
`DenyUsers Dino Pebbles`  
_* Block and Allow certain users_

### Security of a SSH Server

It should be noted that if you open up your firewall and port forward port 22 on a standard SSH server install&#8230; you will probably be hacked. This is extremely reckless and should never be done. I highly recommend doing **ALL** of the following measures if opening up SSH to the outside world.

First, obscure the SSH port by changing it in the sshd_config file  
`# Change Default port 22 to 2222`  
`Port 2222` 

Second, disable Password Authentication and use ssh keys instead. This is a complex procedure and recommend using the following script to optimize the encryption and setup process.

Third, verify you are using tar-pitting or rate limiting on your SSH port. This will prevent brute force attacks  
`ufw limit proto tcp from any port 2222`  
_*Note this can also be done via iptables and it needs to be modified to your SSH port._ 

# Connect via SSH

## Linux terminal

ssh username@serverip

## Windows

PuTTY https://putty.org/ (ssh program)
  
Xming required for X11 forwarding https://sourceforge.net/projects/xming/
  
Verify X11 Forwarding in PuTTY options

# Transfer Files via SSH

The difference between SFTP and SCP by default are one is interactive and the other isn&#8217;t. SCP is faster, but can&#8217;t be resumed where SFTP and slower and can be. 

## Linux

Use the native file browser, in the location bar type the following:  
`sftp://192.168.1.10`

### Using the terminal 

Syntax: **`scp`** `source destination`  
Remote PC Syntax: `username@serverip:/path/to/file`

Example: `scp localfile username@serverip:/remote/server/path`

## Windows

WinSCP is my recommended transfer tool.

pscp.exe for command line. <https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html>
