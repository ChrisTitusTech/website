LVM is a very cool volume management tool. It can be used for a variety of tasks and this guide explains all the things LVM can do. I also do an example video of combining physical hard drives using LVM. <!--more-->

**Acronyms you must know!**  
**PV** &#8211; Physical Volume  
**VG** &#8211; Volume Group  
**LV** &#8211; Logical Volume<figure class="wp-block-image">

## LVM Commands

### LVM Layer 1 &#8211; Hard Drives, Partitions, and Physical Volumes

`lvmdiskscan` &#8211; system readout of volumes and partitions  
`pvdisplay` &#8211; display detailed info on physical volumes  
`pvscan` &#8211; display disks with physical volumes  
`pvcreate /dev/sda1` &#8211; create a physical volume from sda1  
`pvchange -x n /dev/sda1` &#8211; Disallow using a disk partition  
`pvresize /dev/sda1` &#8211; resize sda1 PV to use all of the partition  
`pvresize --setphysicalvolumesize 140G /dev/sda1` &#8211; resize sda1 to 140g  
`pvmove /dev/sda1` &#8211; can move data out of sda1 to other PVs in VG. Note: Free disk space equivalent to data moved is needed elsewhere.   
`pvremove /dev/sda1` &#8211; delete Physical volume

### LVM Layer 2 &#8211; Volume Groups

`vgcreate vg1 /dev/sda1 /dev/sdb1` &#8211; create a volume group from two drives  
`vgextend vg1 /dev/sdb1` &#8211; add PV to the volume group  
`vgdisplay vg1` &#8211; Display details on a volume group  
`vgscan` &#8211; list volume groups  
`vgreduce vg1 /dev/sda1` &#8211; Removes the drive from vg1  
_Note: use pvmove /dev/sda1 before removing the drive from vg1_  
`vgchange` &#8211; you can activate/deactive and change perameteres  
`vgremove vg1` &#8211; Remove volume group vg1  
`vgsplit` and `vgmerge` can split and merge volume groups  
`vgrename`&#8211; renames a volume group

### LVM Layer 3 &#8211; Logical Volumes and File Systems

`lvcreate -L 10G vg1` &#8211; create a 10 GB logical volume on volume group vg1  
`lvchange` and `lvreduce` are commands that typically aren&#8217;t used  
`lvrename`&#8211; rename logical volume  
`lvremove` &#8211; removes a logical volume  
`lvscan` &#8211; shows logical volumes  
`lvdisplay` &#8211; shows details on logical volumes  
`lvextend -l +100%FREE /dev/vg1/lv1`&#8211; One of the most common commands used to extend logical volume lv1 that takes up ALL of the remaining free space on the volume group vg1.  
`resize2fs /dev/vg1/lv1` &#8211; resize the file system to the size of the logical volume lv1. 

## LVM conclusion

LVM is fantastic for managing a system, but remember that the more drives you make in a volume group that the likely it is to fail. Instead of having one point of failure you can open yourself up for multiple points when making a large system with multiple drives.
