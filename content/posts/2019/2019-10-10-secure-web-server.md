In this article, I show you all the steps needed to secure a web server and improve your security. I recommend doing all of these things on every installation. Also, just because you secure your server doesn&#8217;t mean you can neglect it. I highly recommend monitoring it and adjusting security as needed. Monitoring is required for proper security in my opinion. <!--more-->

sudo ufw limit 22/tcp  
sudo ufw allow 80/tcp  
sudo ufw allow 443/tcp

## Change SSH to Key

**Remote Machine**: `ssh-keygen -t rsa`

### Transfer to Server

#### Method 1:

**Transfer pub ssh key to server**  
```
scp ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub user@server.com:~
cat ~/id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

#### Method 2:

Copy key and place in authorized_key file in one command  
`ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub user@server.com`

### Secure a Web Server Disabling Password Auth through SSH

**Change the following lines in /etc/sshd_config**  
```
ChallengeResponseAuthentication no
PasswordAuthentication no
UsePAM no
PermitRootLogin no
```

## Edit /etc/sysctl.conf
