 Notes are vital to our productivity but often people either take too many notes or none at all. I sought to fix this by using a simplistic approach in the Obsidian app. I've tried notion and a variety of other offerings that always fell flat. Let me show you how I set this app for maximum productivity.

## Install Plugins
Open Obsidian Settings
![settings](/images/2022/04-obsidian/plugins.webp)

- Template (Core)

- Dataview (Progress Bar)
- Homepage

## Template Core Plugin

**Set your default template, Note folder to put new files in, and lane width.**

_Note: I recommend leaving 270 width for 1080p screens_

## Homepage Plugin
Adds Home button and just makes it easy to always get back to your kanban to-do page. The homepage button my default will close all open notes and open the to-do or what ever note you specify. Here are my settings:

![homepage plugin](/images/2022/04-obsidian/homepage.webp)

## Dataview Plugin
This is for progress bar, or if you want to do filters, tags, yaml headers, and other sorting techniques. It does WAY more than I use it for at the moment. Since I'm limiting my notes to maybe 10-20 notes I don't need the other stuff, but it is there incase I expand. For now, I will use the following code in my templates to add a progress bar that tracks any checkboxes and how many are checked compared to total. 

```
`="![progress](https://progress-bar.dev/" + round(length(filter(this.file.tasks.completed, (t) => t = true)) / length(this.file.tasks.text) * 100) + "/)"`
```
