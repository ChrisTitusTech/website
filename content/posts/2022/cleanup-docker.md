If you are running docker you will accumulate a lot of unused images and volumes as you update running containers. This makes maintenance a necessity.

## Do you need this?

Check your portainer status page and look for "unused" images and containers. If you are seeing a lot of these, then you are wasting space and I'd recommend running this script to clean them up! 


## The Cleanup Script

Run this bash script every week to ensure the cleanup gets performed. 

```
#!/bin/bash

docker volume rm $(docker volume ls -f dangling=true -q)
docker rmi $(docker images --quiet --filter "dangling=true")
```
