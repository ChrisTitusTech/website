Context menus have become worse in Windows 11 and weren't good in Windows 10. This application will fix it for both modern Windows operating systems.

## The App

I install this app in both Windows 10 and Windows 11. Here is a breakdown of all the context menus that it adds and expands.

- Access the terminal from anywhere (hold shift to run as admin)
- Expanded Files (Create New, Copy Path, and Show hidden)
- Developer Options (Vs code launch, build from explorer, etc.)
- Goto Shortcuts (Common files and folders, System settings, etc.)
- Common sense copy and paste
- Create Shortcuts
- Program your own command!

## Build your own menu and items

Shell is extremely easy to add commands and custom menus. Launch custom commands with arguments. Here is a quick how-to:

Open `C:\Program Files\Nilesoft\Shell\shell.shl`

Add a custom command and pass arguments by editing the dynamic JSON section:

```
dynamic 
{
  item(title='Chris Titus Tech YouTube' cmd='C:\Users\Subscribe\AppData\Local\BraveSoftware\Brave-Browser\Application\brave.exe' args='https://youtube.com/c/ChrisTitusTech')
```

The basic syntax is :

> item(title='sample title' cmd='executable path and exe' args='extra commands')
