Recap of 2022.
<!--more-->

## The 2022 Goals

- [x] Live Streams expanded
- [x] More Virtualization Videos
- [x] More GitHub Projects (Over 500+ Contributions)
- [ ] Custom Debian Build (Debian-Titus)
- [ ] Studio Revamp

The Live streams experiment were a failure. I've ramped up my virtualization content, but find a lot of it go over peoples heads. For GitHub contributions, I started to find my groove about midway through the year, and make substantive progress on projects. The studio revamp is an ongoing project, but to keep making the best use of the space. While I accomplished some of this in 2022, it will be an ongoing process that I will complete next year with a far better layout and feel. 

## 2023 Goals

- [ ] Finish Ubuntu-Titus
- [ ] 1000+ Github Contributions
- [ ] Add Shorts / Live into Weekly workflow while maintaining 3 videos per week
- [ ] Get in best shape of my life

This year will be the best year all around. I made mistakes in 2022 and have a better starting block than I've had in my life both professionally and personally. I can't wait to crush 2023 and make it the best year of my life thus far.
