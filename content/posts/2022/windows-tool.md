This comprehensive utility has been developed and refined over several years, extending far beyond simple Windows debloating capabilities. The tool features an expanded software installation interface with a broader selection than traditional alternatives like Ninite. In addition to the classic debloating functionality, it includes a comprehensive tweaks section designed to enhance user experience and system performance. The utility also incorporates my recommended Windows Update configurations, which have been tested and implemented across various business environments. 

**Important Notice:** Improper use of this utility may compromise your Windows installation. Please exercise caution when applying changes, and note that no technical support is provided for system issues resulting from misuse.

## One Command - Download and Usage

Execute the following command from an elevated PowerShell prompt (Run as Administrator):

```
iwr -useb https://christitus.com/win | iex
```
Alternative shortened version:
```
irm christitus.com/win | iex
```

## Utility Components

The utility consists of four primary modules, with the architecture designed to accommodate future expansion through additional tabs as needed. The current version includes: Install, Tweaks, Features and Legacy Panels, Windows Updates, and MicroWin. Below is a detailed breakdown of each component and their recommended usage. 

### Install

The installation module provides an enhanced alternative to popular tools like Ninite. It leverages Microsoft's WinGet utility to streamline software deployment through a checkbox-based selection interface. This module not only facilitates the installation of a comprehensive software catalog but also provides efficient upgrade management for all installed applications. Utilizing this feature can significantly reduce installation time while simplifying ongoing software maintenance.

### Tweaks

This section includes various tweaks to improve the overall user experience and performance of Windows. These tweaks are carefully selected to avoid any negative impact on system stability while enhancing usability.

Windows debloating presents ongoing challenges due to frequent system updates, and numerous utilities exist to address this need. Many available solutions employ overly aggressive approaches that may compromise system integrity. This utility adopts a more conservative methodology designed to preserve Windows functionality while optimizing performance. The interface features three preconfigured options: Standard and Minimal, each representing curated selections based on extensive testing and recommendations.

**Standard** - Optimizes systems for maximum performance without compromising functionality.

**Minimal** - Implements essential privacy and security configurations with conservative optimizations.

**Critical Warning:** Avoid applying all settings simultaneously or completely removing Microsoft Store components. Such actions may debloat the installation but will compromise Microsoft Store functionality and potentially uninstall applications or games installed through the platform. The complete removal option remains available for users who explicitly require it, though this approach is strongly discouraged.

**Important Note:** Improper use of this module may damage your Windows installation. The utility creates system restore points as a precautionary measure. If significant issues arise, use Windows System Restore or the "Undo All" option to revert changes. This software is provided without warranty, and users assume full responsibility for any system modifications. 

### Features and Legacy Windows Panels

This module simplifies the activation of built-in Windows features that are disabled by default. Many fresh installations require these features, and this interface eliminates the need for manual, individual configuration through various system menus.

Additionally, this section provides access to traditional Windows control panels that remain highly efficient for system administration. These legacy interfaces often prove more streamlined and responsive than their modern Windows 10 and 11 counterparts for experienced users. 

### Windows Updates

The default Windows Update configuration presents significant challenges for users and system administrators. Updates frequently install at inconvenient times and may include unnecessary feature updates that can introduce instability. This module provides two primary configuration options:

**Recommended Configuration:** Installs only security updates while deferring feature updates until they have been thoroughly tested and proven stable over a twelve-month period.

**Disable All Updates:** While this option exists for specific use cases involving legacy software or controlled environments, it is strongly discouraged for general use. This configuration prioritizes system stability over security and should only be implemented in isolated environments where security risks are mitigated through other means. 

Currently, Windows is re-enabling any disabled updates, so this option is not effective. I recommend using Sordum's Windows Update Blocker, which can be found [here](https://www.sordum.org/9470/windows-update-blocker-v1-8/). This tool provides a more reliable method for managing Windows Update settings and preventing unwanted updates. The downside is it has to install a service to block updates, which is not ideal.

### MicroWin

MicroWin represents a streamlined Windows distribution optimized for performance and efficiency. This module systematically removes unnecessary system components and pre-installed applications, delivering a clean, minimalist computing environment. MicroWin is particularly well-suited for users who prioritize system responsiveness and prefer a reduced software footprint without compromising core functionality.
