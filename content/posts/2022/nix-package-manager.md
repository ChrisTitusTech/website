This standalone package manager is absolutely stunning and I can't believe I'm just now discovering it's true power.

## Installation
Source: <https://github.com/NixOS/nix>

```
curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install | sh
```
_Note: I'd recommend multi-user install if it prompts for it._

## Finding Packages
I'd recommend using their website to find packages to install, but make sure to click the "unstable" button has NixOS stable is a Linux Distribution few use. 

<https://search.nixos.org/packages>

Or from terminal you can list all packages with `nix-env -qaP` then just grep what you are looking for. Example: `nix-env -qaP | grep hugo`

## Usage
Here is the basic usage of nix, most revolve around the `nix-env` command. These are manually managed and require user intervention

 - List Installed packages `nix-env -q`
 - Install Packages `nix-env -iA nixpkgs.packagename`
 - Erase Packages `nix-env -e packagename`
 - Update All Packages `nix-env -u`
 - Update Specific Packages `nix-env -u packagename`
 - Hold Specific Package `nix-env --set-flag keep true packagename`
 - List Backups (Generations) `nix-env --list-generations`
 - Rollback to Last Backup `nix-env --rollback`
 - Rollback to Specific Generation `nix-env --switch-generation #`

## Help and Manual
Official Manual is [here](https://nixos.org/manual/nix/stable/). You can also get more details with `man nix` or `man nix-env`. 

## Troubleshooting

### Programs not showing up in start menu

NIX stores all the .desktop files for the programs it installs @ `/home/$USER/.nix-profile/share/applications/` and a simple symlink will fix them not showing up in your start menu.

```
ln -s /home/$USER/.nix-profile/share/applications/* /home/$USER/.local/share/applications/
```
