Linux Atomic Desktops, a concept derived from Fedora's Project Atomic, are designed to provide a more reliable and manageable desktop environment. This initiative extends the principles of atomic updates to Fedora Workstation, aiming to enhance the stability and consistency of the Linux desktop experience.

## What are Linux Atomic Desktops?

Linux Atomic Desktops leverage the concept of atomic updates, which are already popular in server environments through Fedora's Atomic Host. The idea is to treat the desktop as an immutable entity where updates and changes are applied in a single operation that can easily be rolled back if necessary. This approach minimizes disruptions and ensures that system modifications do not affect the overall stability.

## How Do Linux Atomic Desktops Work?

### 1. **Atomic Updates**
   - **Transactional Updates**: Updates are applied as a single transaction. If the update process encounters any issues, it can revert to the previous state, ensuring that the system remains stable and usable.
   - **Ostree**: At the core of atomic updates is Ostree, a tool that manages bootable, versioned filesystem trees. Each update is a new tree, allowing for easy rollback and parallel installations.

### 2. **Containerization**
   - **Flatpak**: Applications are run in isolated environments using Flatpak. This not only enhances security by limiting application access to the system but also allows different applications to use different versions of libraries without conflict.
   - **Podman**: For more complex applications, Podman allows running containers in a manner similar to Docker but without requiring a daemon, aligning with the atomic philosophy of minimal overhead.

### 3. **Immutable Infrastructure**
   - **Read-Only System**: The core system files are treated as read-only, with changes only allowed in specific areas. This reduces the risk of system corruption and unauthorized modifications. Key root folders treated as read-only include:
     - `/usr` (where binaries and libraries are stored)
     - `/boot` (contains boot loader files)
   - **Mutable but Controlled**
     - `/etc` (changes are tracked by ostree and layers will maintain separate versions)
   - **Layered Packages**: Users can still install traditional RPM packages in a layered fashion on top of the base image, which are tracked and can be managed atomically.
     - You can add layered packages with `rpm-ostree install program1 program2 etc`, but doing so will slow down updates as it will need to rebuild the entire ostree and add the layered packages after every update.
     - Note: It is **ALWAYS** recommended to use Flatpak, AppImage, or Containers for applications. (Distrobox or Podman)

## Benefits of Linux Atomic Desktops

- **Reliability**: By minimizing the impact of updates and potential conflicts, the desktop environment becomes more reliable.
- **Consistency**: Every instance of the desktop is consistent with others, reducing discrepancies in software versions and behavior.
- **Security**: The isolation of applications and the immutable nature of the system components enhance the overall security posture.
- **Rollback and Reproducibility**: Easy rollback capabilities and the ability to reproduce environments make management and troubleshooting simpler.

## Making a Linux Atomic Desktop

If you want to dive in and make your own distribution using Atomic Desktops. I recommend the Universal Blue project. <https://blue-build.org/learn/universal-blue/>

## Conclusion

Linux Atomic Desktops represent a significant shift in how desktop environments are managed and maintained. By adopting technologies and methodologies from the server domain, they offer a more stable, secure, and consistent desktop experience. As this technology matures, it could set a new standard for desktop reliability in the Linux ecosystem.
