## Features

- Install Programs - Install multiple programs with a single click.
- Uninstall Programs - Uninstall multiple programs with a single click.
- Update Programs - Update multiple programs with a single click.

## Tweaks

- Use standard tweaks to improve Windows performance.
- I also recommend using the following advanced tweaks:
  - Disable Microsoft Copilot
  - Set Classic Right-Click Menu

**Note: DO NOT click everything in advanced tweaks... your system may become unstable.**

## Updates

- I still recommend Security Updates policy. It delays security updates 4 days and feature updates up to 2 years. This ensures stability and reliability.

## Microwin

The 4 minute install ISO. It is a minimal Windows 10 ISO with WinUtil pre-installed. It is perfect for a fresh install.

No customizations or removals of official Microsoft products... but no added bloatware or apps. Its just like Microsoft used to Package windows during the Windows 7 era.
