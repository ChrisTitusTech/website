## Why Use a VPN?

If you are looking for **privacy** or an **encrypted connection on the go**, setting up a wireguard or openvpn server is a great way to do that. This established a secure connection to your home network and helps block attacks that could happen on the host network providing you internet in a hotel, coffee shop, or other public setting. Setting these up are free and the best way to protect your privacy while helping your maintain a secure connection.

The next use case for a VPN is torrenting or streaming media from another country (geo-unlock). All VPNs generally are advertised as being able to do this, but make sure the VPN does not LOG any user activities and has servers in the country you want to watch streaming from.
