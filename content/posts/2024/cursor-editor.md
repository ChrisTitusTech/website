## Key Features:
- **Ctrl+K**: This feature allows you to edit and write code seamlessly with AI assistance. Whether you're tweaking existing code or generating new code from scratch, Ctrl+K simplifies the process.
- **Copilot++**: Enhance your coding with Copilot++, a native autocomplete feature that suggests mid-line completions and entire diffs, making your coding session smoother.
- **AI Chat**: Engage in a conversation with an AI that understands your codebase. This feature is perfect for debugging or when you need insights about your project.
- **Ctrl+L**: This feature allows you to edit and write code seamlessly with AI assistance. Whether you're tweaking existing code or generating new code from scratch, Ctrl+ L simplifies the process.

## Tips and Tricks:
- **Utilize @ Symbols**: Quickly reference files or code symbols within your project by using the "@" symbol. This can significantly speed up your coding process by allowing you to generate code with specific dependencies or ask about certain files.
- **Fix Lints with Ease**: Cursor's AI can help you fix lint errors instantly. Just hover over any lint error and click the "Fix" button for an AI-generated solution.
- **Terminal Ctrl+K**: Write terminal commands in plain English. This feature is incredibly useful for writing SQL commands, filling in arg parse arguments, or parsing JSONs with jq.
- **Vision**: Use images to prompt the AI. This is especially helpful for web UI development, allowing for rapid iteration based on visual inputs.

## Getting Started:
To experience the full potential of Cursor AI Editor, start by exploring the Ctrl+K feature. It's the gateway to understanding how AI can assist in your coding tasks. Remember, the more you interact with the AI, the better it becomes at predicting and assisting with your coding needs.

Cursor AI Editor is not just a tool; it's a new way of approaching software development. By integrating AI into the coding process, Cursor ensures that developers are equipped with the best resources to build software faster and more efficiently.
