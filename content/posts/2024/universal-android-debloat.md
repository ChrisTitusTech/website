## Getting Started

Before diving into the specifics of using UADNG, ensure you have ADB installed on your computer. ADB, or Android Debug Bridge, is a versatile command-line tool that lets you communicate with a device. The installation process varies depending on your operating system, but detailed instructions can be found on the official Android developer website.

## Installation

1. **Download UADNG:** [Visit the Universal Android Debloater Next Generation GitHub page](https://github.com/Universal-Debloater-Alliance/universal-android-debloater-next-generation) and download the latest release suitable for your operating system.
2. **Extract the Files:** Once downloaded, extract the files to a convenient location on your computer.
3. **Install Dependencies:**
   - **Windows:**
     1. Open PowerShell as Administrator.
     2. Install Chocolatey, the package manager for Windows, by copying the command from [Chocolatey's installation page](https://chocolatey.org/install).
        - *Alternatively* - you can install ADB by downloading it from the [Android Developer website](https://dl.google.com/android/repository/platform-tools-latest-windows.zip).
     3. Once Chocolatey is installed, use it to install ADB by running: `choco install adb`.
   - **Linux:**
     1. Open your terminal.
     2. Most Linux distributions include ADB in their repositories. You can install it using your package manager. For example, on Ubuntu or Debian-based systems, run: `sudo apt-get install adb`.
   - **macOS:**
     1. Open the Terminal.
     2. The easiest way to install ADB is by using Homebrew. If you don't have Homebrew installed, visit [Homebrew's website](https://brew.sh/) for installation instructions.
     3. Once Homebrew is installed, install ADB by running: `brew install android-platform-tools`.
   - **Note:** After installing ADB, you may need to restart your computer or terminal session to ensure the `adb` command is recognized.


## Usage

1. **Enable USB Debugging:** On your Android device, go to Settings > About phone and tap Build number seven times to enable developer options. Then, go to Settings > Developer options and enable USB debugging.
2. **Connect Your Device:** Connect your Android device to your computer using a USB cable.
3. **Run UADNG:** Navigate to the folder where you extracted UADNG and run the executable. The GUI should launch, displaying a list of apps that can be debloated from your device.

## Tips for Using UADNG

- **Backup First:** Always create a backup of your device before removing any apps. This ensures you can restore your device to its original state if needed.
- **Research Before Removing:** Some apps may be critical to your device's functionality. Research each app before deciding to remove it to avoid any unintended consequences.
- **Custom Scripts:** Advanced users can create custom scripts within UADNG to automate the debloating process across multiple devices.
- **Stay Updated:** Keep UADNG updated to benefit from the latest features and app removal lists. Developers frequently update the tool to include new debloat options and improve compatibility.
