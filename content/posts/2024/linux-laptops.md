Linux Laptops are a niche market, but often misunderstood as there are only 3 acceptable Linux Laptops I would daily drive. System76, Kfocus, and Tuxedo. Let me explain why.
<!--more-->

## Why just 3 manufacturers?

There are plenty of manufacturers that sell laptops with Linux pre-installed, but only 3 that I would recommend. The reason is simple, these 3 manufacturers have the best support for Linux, the best hardware compatibility, and have regression testing on updates.

What about Dell, HP, Lenovo, and others? They are great manufacturers, but they are not Linux manufacturers. They do not have the same level of support for Linux as System76, Kfocus, and Tuxedo. They do not have the same level of hardware compatibility, and they do not have ANY regression testing on updates.

Simply put, These vendors control the Linux updates so the hardware always performs well. They have the best support for Linux, and they have the best hardware compatibility.

## What about Framework?

Framework is amazing laptop from a modular and compatibility point of view. Many Linux users do choose it because of it's Linux compatibility. However, they do not control the updates on the laptop via repo and can have regressions especially on distributions like Arch or Fedora where they kernel updates quickly. 

## Are regressions a big deal? 

Yes and No. I find them just annoying most of the time. There has been numerous times that my sleep stopped working from a regression or having performance problems from a regression. These aren't "deal breakers", but they do require you to downgrade the kernel back to the last version while it gets fixed and hopefully reported.

## Price Premium

Most of these laptops I mentioned above come at a price premium and good hardware, but overpriced when looking at from a spec sheet. Almost every Linux laptop manufacture sources their hardware from Clevo Computers. However, each vendor above makes different build options and changes to their specifications. 

The price premium comes into play when you look at the software that comes loaded on them. 

### Tuxedo

- Tomte - Debian based package for driver/system configuration
- Tuxedo Control Center - GUI for General Utility
- Tuxedo OS - KDE Based Ubuntu
- WebFAI - USB Network Reload
- Germeny-Based with servers overseas

### Kfocus

- Validated Kubuntu Systems - KDE Based Ubuntu
- Extensive "Curated Apps" AKA Bash Scripts - <https://kfocus.org/wf/apps.html>
- Kfocus Tool has amazing power optimization
- CUDA, ML, and Ai Libraries that are automatically installed and configured

### System76

- CoreBoot Option - Certain systems have Intel ME removed
- Pop_OS! Distro - All systems built with Pop preloaded
- System76 Firmware - The most involved vendor for system customization
- GNOME-Based right now, but COSMIC is on the horizon

## BTW, I use Arch

If you are going to load Arch Linux or Fedora on any of the above laptops. DO NOT BUY THEM! You are throwing away money buying from these vendors if you don't use any of their work. The benefits above are the REASON YOU BUY THEM! If you are just going to wipe out the system, use a Framework or other Linux compatible laptop that doesn't cost the premium. 

Personally, I use the (Kfocus ir16 laptop)[https://kfocus.org/spec/spec-ir16.html] right now because it is my business laptop that I want to ALWAYS work. I don't load Fedora or Arch on it. I don't want to worry about updates screwing something up. I just open it and go, but I've used Tuxedo for the same thing in the past for several years as well. I'm sure System76 would also be stable as well, but I hate GNOME's look and feel. 

You will also notice my last couple laptops are more of a "base model". No Dedicated GPUs (dGPU) because this would give me less battery life, higher power usage, and more noise. I'm not looking to game on my laptops... I just want to get work done.

## The Future

I'm looking forward to the future in the laptop space. The two things I am looking forward to: COSMIC Desktop Environment and Immutable Distributions shipped on Laptops. We haven't seen this yet, but it is an amazing opportunity and I know my views will change once these are stable and shipped.
