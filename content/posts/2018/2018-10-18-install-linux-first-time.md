In conclusion, this will get you started with Linux. It is a steep learning curve starting out, but well worth it in the end. After you install Linux for the first time, you will need some time to adjust. I personally did this for my Mother-In-Law and she loves it. She never has to worry about viruses or her computer crashing, which was happening often in Windows, and it was the perfect solution for her.
