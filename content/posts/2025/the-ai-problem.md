Do we really need Google Gemini, Apple Intelligence, or Microsoft CoPilot?

## A Solution without a Problem

Big Tech (Google, Microsoft, and Apple) are pushing these AI assistants down our throat. They don't really solve anything that we have a problem with. It should also be noted that they understand how bad the optics of these AI assistants are, so they are very adamant at pointing out that the data gathered does NOT get uploaded to their servers. However, they are very vague on what they actually do with our data... other than it is always watching and keeping track of EVERYTHING we do on our devices. They have also never explicitly said that it doesn't create profiles of our usage, nor have they said they can NOT remotely access it. 

The other issue is it ingesting all your data to "improve" AI. This has a variety of benefits for these large companies as they can use these profiles for advertising packages to sell to other companies. Companies like Roomba have even leaked the screenshots its vacuum took of a woman on the toilet back in 2020. *Source:* <https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/12/19/1065306/roomba-irobot-robot-vacuums-artificial-intelligence-training-data-privacy/> Do we really want to trust Microsoft, Apple, or Google with all our sensitive information? If the AI vacuum company did this... Think about everything you have ever done on your Phone or PC being looked at by "AI".

They also use this data to improve "AI" and that data is ours. They are taking it without asking nor are they upfront about how its able to learn by ONLY using OUR DATA! 

## AI can be good

Things like programming can be wonderful. GPT, Claude and many other LLMs are fantastic, but are isolated use cases. Most of what people call AI isn't AI at all. They are ways to extract more money with minimal investment out of their users. They slap "AI Powered" on the side and are able to move more software or retail boxes of that product without anything else being done. Most of the AI products like Gemini, Copilot or Apple AI are surveillance software to extract advertising information or profile users for their own means while giving very little value to the end user. Where "AI" is beneficial is when it is used like an auto-correct on steroids. Photos, Programming, Correcting mistakes, and much more, but giving access to your entire system is a bridge too far and it must remain isolated or you give up your privacy, independence, and hard work.
