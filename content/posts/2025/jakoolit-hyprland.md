Hyprland has always been an elusive setup to a functional desktop that I enjoy. However, I recently explored JaKoolit and it has been a game changer. This is a guide on how to setup JaKoolit Hyprland on your system.

## What systems are compatile with JaKoolit Hyprland?

[JaKoolit Hyprland](https://github.com/JaKooLit) is compatible with the following systems:
- Ubuntu 24.04
- Ubuntu 24.10
- Arch Linux
- Fedora
- NixOS

He also created basic scripts for each distro repository to install his version of hyprland.

## How to install JaKoolit Hyprland

You can follow his direct instructions, but I wanted to make it easier for people, so I made his scripts directly integrated into [Linutil](https://github.com/ChrisTitusTech/linutil). This way you can install JaKoolit Hyprland with a single command.

The best part of this is Linutil will auto-detect which distro you are on and install the correct version of JaKoolit Hyprland.

```
curl -fsSL christitus.com/linux | sh 
```

Look under System setup and you'll see the option to install JaKoolit Hyprland.
