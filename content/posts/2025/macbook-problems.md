I am a Linux user and I hate Apple, but a good friend at work won't shut up about how good the MacBook is. I've made fun of him for the past 4 years for using a MacBook... but something unthinkable happened. I bought one and documented the experience.

## Initial Problems

Mac users love to say... "It just works!" and that is bullshit. Most of the MacBook defaults are made by a crackhead on LSD with a love of screen animations. For the artsy people out there, it's fine, but for a functional Linux user... it is awful. However, anything can be changed and fixed!

### Interface and Animation Issues
- Scale/Genie effects for all icons in the dock
- Mission Control has slide/fade animations
- Mission Control spaces reorders by usage by default

### Finder Problems
Finder is the worst file manager ever created. My list of hated Finder defaults:
- No status/path bar by default
- Icon view everywhere by default
- Creation of .DS_Store to store the views including network folders (Windows/Linux hate you)
- Sidebar is cluttered and requires cleanup

### System Limitations
- Reduce motion tweaks is a must, but still needs a lot of `sudo defaults` type commands to kill most animations
- Extended unix permissions prevents many 3rd party CLI based downloads not work due to security permissions
- Dock and Top bar are intrusive and Fullscreen mode is bad design
- Window Management is almost non-existent, but at least they added basic tiling in Sequoia
- Dock is bloated, slow, and feels archaic (Magnification on scroll in 2025? LOL!)
- App Store isn't ideal, but it is better than the Windows Store. Homebrew is a decent alternative, but not as good as any Linux package manager.

## Solutions

### Interface and Animation Solutions
- Disable all animations in System Preferences > Accessibility > Display
- Use a minimal dock with only essential apps
- Use Yabai for advanced window management
   - _Aerospace is another alternative but I haven't tried it yet._
- Use a minimal desktop environment like Bartender to manage menu bar icons
- Use a third-party app like Magnet or Rectangle for better window management

### Finder Solutions
- Enable the status bar and path bar in Finder preferences
- Use List view or Column view instead of Icon view
- Use a third-party file manager like Forklift or Commander One
- Use a terminal-based file manager like Ranger or Midnight Commander for advanced users
- `defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles YES` to show hidden files
- `defaults write com.apple.finder ShowPathbar YES` to show the path bar
- `defaults write com.apple.finder ShowStatusBar YES` to show the status bar
- Use website like [macOS Defaults](https://macos-defaults.com/) for more CLI based tweaks

### System Limitations Solutions
- Use `defaults write com.apple.dock autohide-time-modifier -float 0.1` to speed up dock hiding
- Disable SIP (System Integrity Protection) for advanced users who want to modify system files
- Third-party terminal is essential for a good CLI experience:
  - **iTerm2**: What most macOS users use, but not my style
  - **Alacritty**: Great alternative for a fast, minimal terminal
  - **Ghostty**: My favorite full-featured macOS terminal emulator with extensive customization
