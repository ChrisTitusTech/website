## Notable Features

- **Warp Drive**: Warp Drive is a feature that allows you to save documents, files, and notes to Warp and access them from any device. You can invite others to collaborate on a team through it as well.

## Blocks and Filters

Blocks are a feature that separates each command into a block. This allows you to see the output of each command and filter the output.

## Warp Drive

I use to save my notes and is easily accessible from the terminal. It uses standard markdown and can be nice for those that always have a terminal up.

## Warp AI

Warp AI is a feature that allows you to ask questions and get answers in the terminal. A good example of this is complex commands like github usage, regex, or O365 usage. Typically unique commands I'd use once every few months I don't have to to leave the terminal to find anymore.

I don't like the agent mode of Warp AI. It takes over too easily and a lot of the time will run wild without properly displaying output of an error. Asking it simple questions or basic command lookup is great, but I caution against letting it run wild when using the terminal to manage your system.

## Pane Management

This is a feature that allows you to manage multiple panes in the terminal. This is useful for those that need to have multiple terminals open at once.

Default keybindings:

- `Ctrl+Shift+D`: Open a new pane
- `Ctrl+Shift+W`: Close the current pane
- `Ctrl+Shift+[ or ]`: Move the current pane

## Themes

Warp has a lot of themes to choose from. You can also create your own custom themes based on images.
