## Warp Drive

I use to save my notes and is easily accessible from the terminal. It uses standard markdown and can be nice for those that always have a terminal up.

## Warp AI

Warp AI is a feature that allows you to ask questions and get answers in the terminal. A good example of this is complex commands like github usage, regex, or O365 usage. Typically unique commands I'd use once every few months I don't have to to leave the terminal to find anymore.

## Pane Management

This is a feature that allows you to manage multiple panes in the terminal. This is useful for those that need to have multiple terminals open at once.

Default keybindings:

- `Ctrl+Shift+D`: Open a new pane
- `Ctrl+Shift+W`: Close the current pane
- `Ctrl+Shift+[ or ]`: Move the current pane
