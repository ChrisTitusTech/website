Check the website <https://www.cvedetails.com/product-search.php?vendor_id=0&search=Windows> and look up your version of windows. 

You will see that typically the older a version the more exploits it will have. Not all exploits worry me, but the notiable columns to pay attention to are Code Execution and Privilege escalation. 

## Conclusion

Instead of a blanket statement of "Update or you get are a security risk", you can now look at your version and determine how big or small of risk you are taking. \
