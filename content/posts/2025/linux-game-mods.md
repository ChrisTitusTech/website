## Nexus Mods App

There has been Mod Manager, Vortex, and many other apps out there, but none of them were very good on Linux. Nexus is now making an app that is MEANT to be on Linux.

- Latest Release: <https://github.com/Nexus-Mods/NexusMods.App/releases/latest>

## Compatible Games in v0.6.3

- Stardew Valley
- Cyberpunk 2077
- Baldur's Gate III
- Bannerlord


## Current Development

They are working on load order and a few other additions. They are making steady progress and like that they have a good foundation of just releasing an AppImage/binaries. This is important because too many Linux projects only release deb or rpm distro specific releases and they are using a more universal road that will be Steamdeck compatible.

## Roadmap for Next Games

- Bethesda Games (Skyrim/Fallout/Starfield)
- Xbox Game Pass
- Witcher 3
