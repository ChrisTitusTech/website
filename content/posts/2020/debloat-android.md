4. Scroll down, and check the “Android debugging” or “USB debugging” entry under “Debugging”.
5. Plug your device into your computer.
6. On the computer, open up a terminal/command prompt and type adb devices.
7. A dialog should show on your device, asking you to allow usb debugging. Check “always allow”, and choose “OK”.

## ADB Commands - These only work when device is booted
  - `adb devices` - shows all connected adb devices
  - `adb shell` - launches a shell on the device
  - `adb shell pm list packages` - list all installed packages on the device
  - `adb shell pm list packages -3"|cut -f 2 -d ":` - lists all user installed packages
  - `adb push <local> <remote>` - pushes the file <local> to <remote>
  - `adb pull <remote> [<local>]` - pulls the file <remote> to <local>. If <local> isn’t specified, it will pull to the current folder.
  - `adb logcat` - allows you to view the device log in real-time. You can use adb logcat -b radio to view radio logs, and adb logcat -C to view logs in colour
  - `adb install <file>` - installs the given .apk file to your device
  - `adb uninstall com.packagename` - uninstalls package from shell pm list packages
    - *Note: if you encounter "[DELETE_FAILED_INTERNAL_ERROR]" type this to bypass:* `adb shell pm uninstall --user 0 <appname>`
  - `adb reboot` - reboots system
