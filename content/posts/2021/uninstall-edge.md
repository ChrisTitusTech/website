This goes over Removing Microsoft Edge Chromium edition and keeping it removed. 
<!--more-->

## The Problem

Microsoft Edge has taken over PDF viewer, and other default web tasks. Even when manually removing it will reinstall via windows updates.

## Removing the Base Install

We first need to find the Edge install of the chromium edition in your Program Files. 

Location:

```
C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\Edge\Application\
```

The setup program is what we need to uninstall edge. Go to the location above and drill down from the number and Install folder

Example:

```
C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\Edge\Application\92.0.902.62\Installer
```

Once you find your path you can now uninstall edge with the following command _(Note: YOURS WILL BE DIFFERENT!)_

```
C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\Edge\Application\92.0.902.62\Installer\setup.exe --uninstall --system-level --verbose-logging --force-uninstall
```

## Keep it from coming back... for now

You now need to add a registry entry. The following location `Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\EdgeUpdate` needs to be added with a DWORD called `DoNotUpdateToEdgeWithChromium` with a value of `1`. 

You can do this with a simply reg file. (`stopedge.reg`)

```
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\EdgeUpdate]
"DoNotUpdateToEdgeWithChromium"=dword:00000001
```

Create this file or download the file @ https://christitus.com/files/stopedge.zip

Run this to prevent edge reinstallation. *Note: Microsoft will kill this workaround in the future and force edge on you*
