## All-In-One Pack

This Pack is everything below so you can swap between them. It is a custom script I made so I can choose any of my favorite bootloaders below. This may not include original project updates as they happen, so check the source links below if one of the themes doesn't work for you! 

### Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/ChrisTitusTech/Top-5-Bootloader-Themes
cd Top-5-Bootloader-Themes
sudo ./install.sh
```
