This article shows you what to do if you get the rewrite.dll failed to load in Windows 10 event viewer for Windows 10 IIS.<!--more-->

### Commands

Checked Event viewer when my website Showed up with
  
`Service Unavailable 503 error`
  
The Event Viewer Error was
  
`The Module DLL C:\WINDOWS\system32\inetsrv\rewrite.dll failed to load`
  
I went into Add/Remove Programs (Start -> Run-> appwiz.cpl) and simply repaired the following program
  
`IIS Url Rewrite Module 2.0`

### Troubleshooting/Download

Afterward, restart your WWW Service in services.msc and your website will now be working. If you are unable to repair the IIS rewrite module using Add/Remove Programs, you will need to redownload them from Microsoft.
