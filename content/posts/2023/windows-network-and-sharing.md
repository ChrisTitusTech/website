Fixing problems with windows file sharing using the following methods.
<!--more-->

_Note: Check ALL these methods as anyone of them can cause file sharing to fail!_

## Network and File Sharing

Launch old control panel with `Start -> Run -> control` or `Windows Key + R` and select Network and Sharing Center.

Follow these Steps from Network and Sharing Center

- Select Advanced Sharing Settings
- Turn on network discovery and check Turn on automatic setup of network connected devices.
- Turn on file and printer sharing
- Optional: If you don't want passwords click "All Networks and turn off Password protected sharing"

## Check if Network is classified Public

If your network is classified as Public it will NOT allow you to share files or printers! Check it with powershell:

- Launch Powershell (right-click start menu and select powershell with admin or terminal with admin)
- Type `Get-NetConnectionProfile`
- Verify NetworkCategory is PRIVATE!
- If it is Public Type `Set-NetConnectionProfile -Name "Network #" -NetworkCategory Private`

_Note: Change Network # to the NAME of your Network from `Get-NetConnectionProfile`_

## Share your folders

Right-click any folder and select "give access to" and select your login user. On new Windows 11/10 systems this is often your microsoft account (user@outlook.com). If you turned off password sharing and want EVERYONE to see those files then type "Everyone" and give access to them. 

Another option is to right-click the folder and select properties. Then select the sharing tab and give access through there.
