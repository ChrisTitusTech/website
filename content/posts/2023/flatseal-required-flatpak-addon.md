Managing Flatpak permissions and file storage outside of the flatpak can be difficult to manage. Flatseal fixes all that!

## Installing Flatseal

## Using Flatseal

View each flatpak permissions

See user modified permissions

Reset permissions in the top right corner

The thing I use the most is filesystem access. This lets you specify the flatpak can read from other parts in the filesystem.

This is the best way to manage and maintain flatpaks with ease and it's the first thing I install after the base flatpak!
