Pulling in EXT4 drives is easy now with Windows WSL2. There are a few tricks that you need to know about though!
<!--more-->

## Requirements

- Any version of Windows 11
- Any version of Windows 10 (Build 22000+) _Note: check with `winver` from Run_
- Powershell as Admin and WSL 2 installed
- ONLY Internal drives are supported. No USB Drives.

## Determine Partition to Mount

### PowerShell as Admin 

List Drives

```
GET-CimInstance -query "SELECT * from Win32_DiskDrive"
```

Mount and list Drive Partitions

```
wsl --mount <DiskPath> --bare
wsl
```

### Linux WSL2 Instance

List Drive Partitions from WSL Instance

```
lsblk
```

List Drive Types and IDs

```
sudo blkid
```

### PowerShell as Admin 

_Note: By default Windows will always assume it is EXT4, unless the `-t vfat` option is used._

From Windows PowerShell

```
wsl --mount \\.\PhysicalDrive1 --partition 2
```

This will make it available in both Windows Explorer and WSL `/mnt/wsl/PhysicalDrive1` path. 

#### Unmount

```
wsl --unmount \\.\PhysicalDrive1
```
