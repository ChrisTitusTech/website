I've made a LOT of GitHub mistakes! Here is a list of things most new users do not know or do WRONG!
<!--more-->

## Raw Files

- Raw Button
- Raw Files only update every few minutes

## Using Branches and Release Tags

- list branches with `git branch -a`
- clone a specific branch with `git clone -b main https://github.com/christitustech/winutil`
- list tags and releases with `git fetch --all --tags`
- checkout tag with `git checkout tags/v1.0`
- see a log of commits and tags `git log --oneline --graph`

## Pull Requests

Pull requests are a great way of collaboration. However, most developers joke that they just close and don't merge most public pull requests. This is mainly because there can be a lot of low quality or hap-hazard commits. I've seen this in many of projects and have made strict requirements before accepting any. The biggest rule I stole from Linus Torvalds, "Never merge a pull request that you do NOT understand."



## Issues

## Rolling back commits and Referencing them

## Rebase

## Unit Tests
