## Linus Response

Overview:

## My Thoughts

LTT is a media company and most YouTubers make mistakes and have favoritism with their reviews. As LinusTechTips has grown there is a ton of bias from owning a stake in framework laptops and hiring industry people such as Gary Key for LTT Labs that used to be the Sr. Marketing Director for ASUS.

LTT Labs is silly and too much overhead for their business. They need to push out tons of videos with very little review time to continue to grow into a huge business. They need to reduce their overhead to increase the quality of their videos... NOT INCREASE IT! If they employ 120 people, they simply can't afford to NOT publish a video or take one down. If a sponsor is paying good money to have a video published, they don't have the luxury of NOT publishing it. 

The drop in replacement ability for these big channels is messed up and they can simply revise history by changing existing videos. This can skirt responsibility and gaslight people which looks like Linus has done.

YouTube is a marketing platform and bias does exist. Reviews can never be 100% trusted by anyone. However, the best thing about YouTube is the comments and the fact the audience can call out the YouTuber and the thing I love the most is learning from my mistakes on YouTube.
