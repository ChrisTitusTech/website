### Redownload Windows Utility

If you already bought this prior to 2024, you need to do the following to redownload:

Click Buy Now and entering in the email address you bought it under and the discount code "CTT" to redownload it for free.

### Virus Detected

If the Utility gets flagged, you can make an exclusion in your Antivirus software. I like to make a new folder and exclude it then download the zip file to that folder. 

Here is how to do it in Windows Defender:
- Select Start  , then open Settings  . Under Privacy & security  , select Virus & threat protection.
- Under Virus & threat protection settings, select Manage settings, and then under Exclusions, select Add or remove exclusions.
- Select Add an exclusion, and then select from files, folders, file types, or process. A folder exclusion will apply to all subfolders within the folder as well.

### Cannot Download

This can happen due to *SMARTSCREEN* which checks ALL downloaded files directly in browser.

Open Windows Security:
 - Go to Start → Settings → Privacy & Security → Windows Security → Open Windows Security
 - Click on “App & Browser Control”.
 - Click “Reputation-based protection settings”.
 - *Disable SmartScreen - Toggle the switches off for:*
    - “Check apps and files”
    - “SmartScreen for Microsoft Edge”
    - “SmartScreen for Microsoft Store apps”
    - Potentially unwanted app blocking

### Toolbox Opens and Immediately Closes

It needs to be **Run As Administrator.** Right click the exe and select this option to run on the computer.
