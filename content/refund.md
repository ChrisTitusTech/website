## Refund policy

We have a 30-day return policy, which means you have 30 days after receiving your item to request a return.

To start a return, you can contact us at contact@christitus.com. 

You can always contact us for any return questions at contact@christitus.com.

### European Union 14 day cooling off period

Notwithstanding the above, if the merchandise is being shipped into the European Union, you have the right to cancel or return your order within 14 days, for any reason and without a justification. As above, your item must be in the same condition that you received it, unworn or unused, with tags, and in its original packaging. You’ll also need the receipt or proof of purchase.

### Refunds

If approved, you’ll be automatically refunded on your original payment method within 10 business days. Please remember it can take some time for your bank or credit card company to process and post the refund too.
If more than 15 business days have passed since we’ve approved your return, please contact us at contact@christitus.com.
